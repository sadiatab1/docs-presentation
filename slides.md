# Introduction to Our Product

This presentation provides an overview of our product's key features and how to use them effectively.

---

# Key Features

- **Feature A**: A brief description.
- **Feature B**: Another key feature.
- **Feature C**: A third important feature.

---

# Algorithmic Complexity

The complexity of our core algorithm can be expressed as:

$$O(n \log n)$$

This represents an efficient and scalable solution for handling large datasets.

---

# Data Structures

The system relies on various data structures, such as a balanced binary search tree, which maintains an optimal search time.

Let's consider the height of such a tree, $h$, which is related to the number of nodes, $N$, by the equation:

$$h = O(\log N)$$
